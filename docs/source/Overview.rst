Overview
========

N2G is a library to produce XML text files structured in a format supported for opening and editing by these applications:

* yWorsk yEd Graph Editor graphml format
* Diagrams (formally DrawIO) drawio format

Above applications can be downloaded and installed on your system for free at the time of creating this module.

N2G contains dedicated modules for each format (one for yEd, one for DrawIo) with very similar API that can help create, load, modify and save diagrams. 

However, due to discrepancy in functionality and peculiarities of applications itself, N2G modules API is not 100% identical and differ to reflect particular application capabilities.
